Files in this directory are part of the excellent **cc65** compiler, which is also [hosted](http://github.com/cc65/cc65) on GitHub.

I am including the compiler configuration files I am using for reference.  I include the cc65 extended memory driver `a2e.auxmem.emd` because I include that file on the demonstration diskette image.

As of May 27 2018, I have been building EightBall using cc65 version 2.15, although I plan to switch to a newer version in due course.

You may use the latest version of cc65 from GitHub if you prefer.  In that case you should use the version of these files that is distributed with cc65.
